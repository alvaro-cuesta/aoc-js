# üéÑ AoC JS

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions in JavaScript.

## Commands

Most commands require you to setup a session cookie. The recommended way is to
create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`) with your session cookie (just login
to AoC and take the cookie value from your browser's network inspector).

### Development

- `yarn watch` / `yarn watch <year>` / `yarn watch <year>/<day>`
- `yarn test` / `yarn test <year>` / `yarn test <year>/<day>`
- `yarn download-test-input`: recreates all `DD.test.input` files. Old input
  files will be overwritten. This means existing tests will fail since the test
  output matches the ones from my AoC user.

### Solutions

- `yarn all`
- `yarn year <year>`
- `yarn day <year> <day>`
- `yarn part <year> <day> <part>`
